## Dotfiles and Install Script

Clone the dotfiles git repository into the users home directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:safinn/dotfiles.git ~/
```

Run the `install.sh` script:

```sh
sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

### SSH

The script will first start the SSH agent for us and generate a new SSH key for our machine. The SSH key will be added to our `~/.ssh/config` file to be used against the host `github.com`. The private key is then added to the SSH agent and the public key copied into the clipboard. The script will wait until the key has been added to our GitHub SSH settings.

### Brew

packages are installed especially:

- fnm to manage node versions
- stow to allow managing out dotfiles

casks (GUI application) are install:

- 1password
- brave browser
- vs code (sync settings and extensions)
- docker

fnm install node

any existing dotfiles that we are going to stow are removed the files from our cloned repo are stowed.

some further mac settings are configured
