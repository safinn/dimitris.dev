## Getting Started With Mise

#### Install

```shell
curl https://mise.run | sh # install
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc # activate
# for other shells see details
```

*Make sure you restart your shell session after modifying your rc file in order for it to take effect*

<details>
<summary>Install details</summary>

The install script will download the binary to `~/.local/bin/mise`.
Activating allows mise to add itself to the PATH and register a shell hook to run [mise hook-env](https://mise.jdx.dev/faq.html#what-does-mise-activate-do) every time the shell prompt is displayed.

Adding mise activation in other shells:
```shell
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
</details>

#### Install Global Tools

```shell
mise use -g node pnpm@9 go@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Install global tools details</summary>

`mise use` will install and activate the tools so it is available to use immediately. The `-g` flag globally installs tools so they are available anywhere they are not overwritten by "local" tools.

We can run `go version` (and equivalent for the other tools) now and see we have the latest (at the time of writing) `go version go1.22.5 darwin/arm64`

The global configuration is saved in `~/.config/mise/config.toml`.

#### Install Directory Tools

```shell
touch .mise.toml
mise use node@20 # lts at the time
mise use pnpm
```

<details>
<summary>Install directory tools details</summary>

Once we create a `.mise.toml` file in the root of our project we can use the same `mise use` (without the `-g` flag) commands to install tool specific for that project. This will update the current directory `.mise.toml` file configuration.

Users who encounter an existing `.mise.toml` file simply run `mise install` to get all tools listed in the config with the correct versions.

When not in our project directory, the global version of node (latest) will be used but when we `cd` into our project directory with `.mise.toml` node version 20 will be used. Try printing the version to see for yourself in different directories.

Globally we might live on the edge and install the latest `node` version but for this specific project we are using the long-term support version.

#### Shims

mise updates the PATH every time the shell prompt is displayed. In non-interactive use-cases where there is no shell prompt, the PATH is not updated. [Shims](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html) give us access to the mise tools in non-interactive environments.

I use [starship](https://starship.rs/) as a shell prompt so I install it globally:
```shell
mise use -g starship
```

For starship to work, we need to initialise it by adding the following line to `~/.zshrc`
```shell
eval "$(starship init zsh)" # broken
```

But this will not work because `.zshrc` has ran in a non-interactive session (and no prompt displayed) and mise has not been able to add starship to the path. mise provides shims for the tools in `~/.local/share/mise/shims` so we can change our `.zshrc` command to use the mise starship shim and we are good to go.

```shell
eval "$(~/.local/share/mise/shims/starship init zsh)"
```
